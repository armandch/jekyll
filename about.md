![Me](/assets/profile_photo.png)

This is my personal website/blog.  I plan to use this site as a place to store my notes, mostly technology related, as well.

I love UNIX, text adventure games, photography, Jazz, cat, and Apple products.

If you have any thought or feedback you want to share with me, or simply just want to make a new friend, please contact me via Twitter!
